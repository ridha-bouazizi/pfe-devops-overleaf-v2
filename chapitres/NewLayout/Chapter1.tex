\section*{Introduction}

\hspace{7mm}Understanding the project's goals and expected outcomes is crucial. This chapter offers a comprehensive understanding of the project's context, including problem statement, objectives, scope, and requirement analysis, with the aim of clarifying the project's purpose and expected outcomes.

\section{The project's background}
\hspace{7mm}In the following section we focus on providing an overview on the host organization and its fields of activities. 
\subsection{Overview on the host organization  }

\hspace{7mm}Systnaps is a technology company based in Paris, France that specializes in providing innovative software solutions to businesses across various industries. It prides itself with the expertise in areas such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing. The following figure illustrates the company logo: 

\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,angle=00]{assets/fa.png}
\caption{Company logo: "Systnaps"}
\end{figure}

\hspace{7mm}Huxium, an affiliate of Systnaps is a technology company that specializes in providing customized software solutions to businesses across various industries. 


\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,angle=00]{assets/fb.png}
\caption{Company logo: "Huxium"}
\end{figure} 
\newpage
\hspace{7mm}The core services of Systnaps in the data management space include: 
\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
    \item Database Management: Securely managing databases for businesses, including tasks such as administration, optimization, and recovery. 

\item Data Integration: Assisting businesses in integrating and managing data across multiple systems and platforms, encompassing activities like migration, warehousing, and synchronization. 

\item Big Data: Supporting businesses in managing and analyzing large volumes of data (often known as "big data"), involving tasks such as processing, visualization, and machine learning. 

\item  Data Governance: Helping businesses ensure compliance with regulatory and legal requirements in managing their data, encompassing activities such as privacy and security, classification, and retention. 

 \end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Analysis of existing processes }

\hspace{7mm}The current infrastructure relies on a few monolithic virtual private servers and utilizes Docker Compose for container orchestration. Within this infrastructure, there are multiple Docker Compose stacks serving different purposes, including: 
\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
\item An application development stack: This stack houses essential applications for software development, such as code editors, compilers, and development frameworks. 

\item A utility stack : includes a self-hosted enterprise instance of GitLab, which serves as a version control system and facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes for applications. Additionally, the stack includes a self-hosted instance of Nextcloud, a file hosting and sharing platform utilized for storing and sharing files relevant to application development. 

\item A reverse proxy stack: This stack comprises three Docker images - acme-companion, docker-gen, and nginx - functioning as a reverse proxy for the application. Nginx acts as the web server, routing traffic to the application, while acme-companion and docker-gen generate SSL/TLS certificates and automatically update the Nginx configuration. 
\end{itemize}

\hspace{7mm}While Docker Compose provides a lightweight and scalable infrastructure for application development, the reliance on monolithic virtual private servers can hinder scalability and infrastructure maintenance. Consolidating all services on a single server creates a single point of failure and increases the risk of downtime. 

\subsection{Constructive criticism on existing processes} 

\hspace{7mm}Based on cloud computing and DevSecOps best practices, the following is some of the weak points of such an infrastructure :

\begin{itemize}[label={--}]

\item Docker Compose for orchestration: While suitable for small-scale projects, it becomes challenging to manage and maintain as the number of services and containers grows. Kubernetes offers a more scalable and efficient solution for container orchestration and management. 

\item Lack of a distributed storage backend: The absence of distributed storage can lead to data loss or inconsistency during node failures. Kubernetes provides built-in options like persistent volumes, stateful sets, and storage classes for distributed storage. 

\item Absence of an authorization and authentication backend: The lack of an authorization and authentication system can result in security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Kubernetes offers several options for authentication and authorization, including role-based access control (RBAC), webhook token authentication, and client certificate authentication. 

\item Missing disaster recovery strategy: Without a disaster recovery plan, there is a risk of significant downtime and data loss during unforeseen events. Kubernetes provides options for disaster recovery, such as backup and restore mechanisms, failover and recovery strategies, and multi-zone deployments. 

\item Use of large and inefficient container images: Large and inefficient container images can lead to slower deployment times, increased storage requirements, and decreased performance. DevSecOps best practices, coupled with Kubernetes features like image caching, rolling updates, and horizontal scaling, can optimize container image management and deployment. 

\end{itemize}

\hspace{7mm}In conclusion, adopting Kubernetes and implementing cloud computing and DevSecOps best practices can significantly enhance the scalability, reliability, security, and performance of the IT ecosystem. 
\newpage
\subsection{Problem statement }

\hspace{7mm}In today's fast-paced business environment, the company recognizes the importance of leveraging cloud computing and DevSecOps practices to gain a competitive edge. 

\hspace{7mm}However, building and managing a reliable and scalable PaaS platform for infrastructure services is a complex task. Without a well-designed and integrated PaaS platform, there is a risk of increased costs, inefficient resource utilization, and security vulnerabilities.

\hspace{7mm}The objective of this project is to design, build, and implement a comprehensive PaaS platform that offers a wide range of infrastructure services, such as networking, storage, database, and utility services. Additionally, a resilient and efficient disaster recovery strategy will be incorporated, along with adherence to DevSecOps practices for enhanced security and compliance with industry standards.

\hspace{7mm}The main challenge of this project lies in ensuring the scalability, availability, and security of the PaaS platform, while providing a simple and intuitive user experience for developers. This requires a deep understanding of cloud computing, DevSecOps practices, and expertise in networking, storage, database, and utility services.

\hspace{7mm}The successful implementation of this project will enable the company to accelerate their digital transformation journey, reduce operational costs, and improve overall business agility. By harnessing the power of cloud computing and DevSecOps, the company will be better equipped to meet the evolving demands of the market and stay ahead of the competition.

\subsection{Ideation and Proposed Solutions} 

\hspace{7mm}The company has decided to explore the possibility of moving to a cloud-based infrastructure to increase scalability, availability, and security. After analyzing various options, we have decided to propose a self-managed PaaS platform based on Kubernetes that contains the following components: 

\begin{itemize}[label={--}]

\item Networking services: The networking services will be provided by MetalLB for layer 4 load balancing, Traefik as an ingress controller, and Cert-manager for TLS provisioning. The platform will also use Authelia, OpenLDAP, and Redis for authentication/authorization. 

\item A Storage backend: The storage backend will be provided by Ceph, which is a distributed and redundant storage backend for both object and block storage. This will ensure that data is highly available and can be easily scaled. 

\item Highly available and replicated database storage services: The platform will use both MongoDB and PostgreSQL as highly available and replicated database storage services for both the relational and document models. This will provide the necessary data persistence and redundancy required for a PaaS platform. 

\item DevSecOps utility services: The platform will use several utility services to help store artifacts, automate CI/CD operations, and improve code quality. These services include Jenkins as the CI/CD orchestrator, ArgoCD as the CD controller, SonarQube for code scanning, Harbor as a private registry, and Jenkins pipelines to automate building applications, scanning, and delivery. 

\item Disaster recovery strategy: The platform will have a resilient and efficient disaster recovery strategy that uses Velero to back up Kubernetes related objects and proprietary Python programs to backup database data. This will ensure that the platform is highly available, even in the event of a disaster. 

\end{itemize}
 
\section{Project planning}

\hspace{7mm}The following section will be dedicated our choice of Agile method. We will then look at the functional and non-functional requirements related to this project.

\subsection{Project management }
\subsubsection{Comparative research }

\hspace{7mm}Let us first inspect the characteristics of different agile methods in order to decide on the most useful to follow :

\subsection{Capturing requirements}

\hspace{7mm}Our analysis is aimed at identifying the key actors in our design, the functional and non-functional needs our system is to provide for.

\subsubsection{Identifying key actors}

\hspace{7mm}In this context, an actor is a user or any other system that interacts with the subject by exchanging signals and data.

\paragraph{Cloud architecture related actors:}
\hspace{7mm}In order to have a DevSecOps compliant approach, it needs to be built on top of a containerized, highly available cloud infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
\item Cloud architect: He is responsible for designing and implementing cloud computing solutions.
\item IaC tools: Although being a piece of software, it is necessary in order to automate provisioning and configuration of resources.
\item Cloud provider: Usually a third-party entity that allows for elastically allocating resources.
\item DevSecOps team: A DevSecOps engineer is the consumer in this case, he uses the provisioned resources to build an ecosystem that is compliant with organizational needs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{CI/CD related actors:}
\hspace{7mm}The cloud resources hold the value of a tool that is then leveraged to assist the development process:
\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
\item DevSecOps team: uses the provisioned resources and follows an agile DevSecOps approach to build an ecosystem that is compliant with organizational needs.
\item Developer: A consumer of the DevSecOps ecosystem as well as the CI/CD workflow.
\item Company client: He is the end user and provides the specifications on software development.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Functional requirements}

\hspace{7mm}Formulating an understanding on functional requirements is a primordial phase in the implementation of the subject.

\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
\item A cloud-based infrastructure capable of hosting the DevSecOps ecosystem in terms of compute resources, storage and networking.
\item A continuous integration platform : The desired goal is to provide a CI workflow that channels the development effort in order to continuously ensure code quality.
\item A CD workflow: provide an automated and continuous delivery and deployment process.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-functional requirements}

\hspace{7mm}In this section, we shift our focus from the specific functionalities of the system discussed earlier to the non-functional requirements that encompass factors such as :

\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
\item High availability and resilience: Typically satisfied by distributed backend resources, orchestration and load balancing of workloads. 
\item Performance and scalability: Usually dependent on the cloud provider as well as the used technologies.
\item Security: An inbuilt quality that cloud and DevSecOps offer by design.
\item Observability: A highly achievable need due to the pluggability of containerized environments.
\item Usability: A somewhat hard to achieve requirement due to the rarity of a technologically adept workforce. 
\item Relatively low cost : the need to prioritize self-hosting and adopting opensource alternatives.
\end{itemize}
